## Overview of Project

The purpose of the analysis was to see if the stocks which were being analyzed were worth investing in after reviewing their volume and yearly return for 2017 and 2018.  You could determine an investment to be positive if the volume and yearly return were on the positive side of things.  Two particular stocks which stood out were ENPH and RUN.  ENPH’s return was 129.5% in 2017 and 81.9% in 2018.  Although RUN’s return wasn’t very high 2017 (5.5%), it jumped back in 2018 with a 84.0% return.

## Results

The refactored VBA script ran at a slightly faster rate than before it was refactored.

## Summary

Refactoring code advantages

The advantages of refactoring code is that it can run efficiently run with faster execution of the code.  This is important if there is a large amount of code.  The quicker the run time, the more efficient the program may run.  Also, refactored code could also be cleaner and easier to read.

Refactoring code disadvantages

Some disadvantages of refactoring code is that it might need constant debugging because it could change the external behavior if done incorrectly.

Pros and cons of refactoring

One of the pros to refactoring code is that it runs faster the code that isn’t refactored.  If you can run code faster, it will be the preferable code to have.  One of the cons of refactoring is that you might have to troubleshoot if writing incorrectly.
